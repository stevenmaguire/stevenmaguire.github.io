StevenMaguire.com has been a revolving door of content and implementation styles. In [2006](https://web.archive.org/web/*/stevenmaguire.com) it started as static HTML and basic CSS. Next it had a strong run as a WordPress site. Later, homegrown PHP and MySQL replaced WordPress. After discovering Laravel, the site entered the modern age of mature framework support.

Now (circa 2014) itâ€™s back to being static HTML and CSS, with some modern goodies to help keep things manageable. These goodies include Jekyll, Bootstrap, and AWS.

## Frontend

<ul>
    <li>Jekyll - static site generator</li>
    <li>Bootstrap - responsive CSS framework</li>
</ul>

## Backend

<ul>
    <li>AWS Lambda - http accessible functions that run code without worrying about servers</li>
</ul>

## Hosting

<ul>
    <li>Codeship.com - free continuous integration and deployment</li>
    <li>AWS S3 - <strike>free</strike> ridiculously cheap static file hosting</li>
</ul>
