Hello - I'm [Steven Maguire](http://twitter.com/StevenMaguire). I've been building software [since 2004](http://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenmaguire). Today, I focus on building healthy, productive technology teams. I strive to build teams offering stability, continuing education, mentorship, and career tracks.

As of November 2019, I am the CTO at [MDHearing](https://www.mdhearingaid.com). MDHearing is a direct-to-consumer manufacturer of affordable hearing aids based in Chicago, IL. The technology stack is PHP and JavaScript.

For the four years prior, I led technology at two Xenon Ventures portfolio companies. First, [Earth Class Mail](https://www.earthclassmail.com), a business mail automation service. Second, [Scripted.com](https://www.scripted.com), a two-sided content marketplace. The technology stacks included Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and C#/.NET. As a member of the small leadership team at both, I helped produce successful turnarounds. I grew the technology teams and stabilized the software platform for both organizations. The properties benefited from dramatic increases in valuation - 300% for Earth Class Mail alone!

I spend some of my remaining time engaging with my community:

- sharing in the [Chicago tech meetup community](http://www.meetup.com/members/40042402/);
- [contributing to open source projects](https://github.com/stevenmaguire);
- [authoring online training material](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/steven-maguire);
- [discussing product development](https://www.phproundtable.com/episode/part-1-turning-an-idea-into-code-for-production);
- and volunteering with [The All-Stars Project, Development School for Youth](http://allstars.org/dsy/). My role at the DSY is a <acronym title="Professional development coach for students 16 to 21 years old">Program Associate</acronym>.

I moved to Chicago in 2010 to work on the [TrainSignal](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/it-educator-trainsignal-acquired-pluralsight-eight-figure-deal) team. I served four years as the technology team leader, product owner, and an engineer. I contributed a fair amount of C#, JavaScript & PHP code. TrainSignal afforded a chance to flex my [UX](http://www.humanfactors.com/certification/CUA.asp) muscles. We built a game-changing subscription-based online learning platform for IT pros. With the launch of the platform, TrainSignal got acquired by [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com).

Following the TrainSignal acquisition, I spent a couple years helping startups in Chicago. I served in many part-time advisory roles. And I served in [one full-time staff role as Head of Engineering for Packback](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/how-i-am-using-technology-disrupt-education-industry); I left Packback in [good hands](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/packback-engineering).

-------------------------------

I graduated from [ECU](http://www.ecu.edu/) in 2008. I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Digital Media Production.

As a result, [filmmaking](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10916763/) became a hobby of mine. I produced a [short film](http://vimeo.com/802365) in my last semester of college. Having relocated to Chicago, I joined teams to produce films for the [48 Hour Film Festival in Chicago, IL](http://www.48hourfilm.com/). First, in 2012, with [Catington Station](http://catingtonstation.com/) for a [silent film](http://vimeo.com/48369036). Second, in 2013, with [Whiskey Muzzle](http://whiskeymuzzle.com) for [another film](http://vimeo.com/72493425). Most recently, in 2019, with Glen's Raptor Gang for [yet another film](https://vimeo.com/355873812).

As a full-time college student, I designed and developed [a lot of small projects](/artwork/). One of my favorite projects was a [blog that focused on people named "Steven"](http://www.axisofstevil.com/). For that project, I conspired with my good friends, [Graham](http://twitter.com/chiatar) and [Rich](http://twitter.com/BreakfastDuck).
