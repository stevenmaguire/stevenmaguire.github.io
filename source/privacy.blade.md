As of last update on October 9, 2024, at StevenMaguire.com, I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting your personal information by not participating in passive surveilance or data collection. This privacy policy explains how I handle any information that may be collected when you visit my website - which is simple, **I don't collect any information**.

## 1. No Information Collected
I do not collect, store, or process any personal data from visitors to my website. I do not ask for or collect any information such as your name, email address, or any other personal details.

## 2. No Cookies or Tracking Technologies
My website does not use cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies. I do not track your browsing behavior, your device, or any other activity on my site.

## 3. No User Interactivity
My website does not include forms, logins, or any other means of user interaction. I do not request, process, or retain any information entered by users.

## 4. Third-Party Services
Since I do not collect any information, I do not share or disclose any data to third-party services or advertisers. I do not embed external content (such as social media widgets or analytics tools) that would result in data collection.

## 5. Security
While I do not collect personal data, I maintain a general security policy to ensure the integrity and security of my website. However, since no personal information is stored, I do not have data-specific security measures in place.
