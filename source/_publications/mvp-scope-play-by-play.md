In this course, you'll see a client interview for a real-world application. We're not coding a solution -- yet. Before starting to code, or even defining domain objects and models, this discovery interview is all about understanding the business, the people involved, and their primary activities. Identifying those key pieces, and the frequency of each activity, will help us focus our efforts on building an application that has the highest impact on operations. This course will teach you how to conduct a successful client discovery meeting, demonstrating some exercises to uncover the key features of a minimum viable product.
