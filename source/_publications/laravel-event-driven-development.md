Join Steven Maguire in designing and building an If This Then That (ifttt) clone project while focusing on the creation, usage, and handling of custom events in a Laravel 5 project. The 45 minute presentation will review the benefits of the Events architecture, a solution design review, code snippets, and a few examples of working code. The presentation will be followed by a Q&A discussion with the whole group.
