At the beginning of 2015 my Github profile was completely empty and I communicated a goal of contributing to one new open source project per month throughout the year. Over the next 12 months my profile grew to include over 40 public repositories, composed mostly of well tested, well documented, easily implemented, framework agnostic PHP libraries. Additionally, I was welcomed into the prestigious League of Extraordinary PHP Packages, where I eventually contributed to the core for two very popular libraries. Today, my individual packages have been downloaded and utilized over 26,000 times and I'd like to spend about an hour sharing some interesting details of this journey with you, and hopefully inspire you to begin getting involved in the open source community; it's not as scary as it may seem.
