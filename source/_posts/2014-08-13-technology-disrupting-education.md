I moved to Chicago in January 2010 to join TrainSignal, a then 20 person company based in Schaumburg, IL., as the only web employee on the payroll. TrainSignal offered IT professional certification training to administrators and practitioners looking to level-up their career with certifications in systems administration, virtualization, networking, and a several other areas of expertise. TrainSignal's founder, Scott Skinger had bootstrapped the business over the previous 7 years selling DVDs of training material to customers exclusively using a variety of over-the-counter ecommerce products.

Over the course of the following years, TrainSignal went through a complete metamorphosis from traditional ecommerce company to technology driven SaaS company. We staffed a technology team of 19, we built a new software infrastructure to publish content, engage with students, collect recurring payments, report key performance indicators, and we learned a lot of valuable lessons about what it means to disrupt the traditional education system with technology.

Our students were life-long learners who consistently communicated a need for the type of education and learning materials that were not available in higher education institutions.

Armed with this information, we delivered a modest set of online learning tools that gave these students exactly what they were looking for; up-to-date interactive training at an affordable price. In February 2013 [TrainSignal relaunched](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/trainsignal-launches-unlimited-demand-training-150000410.html) with zero customers, zero revenue, and a clear mission to grow for the future. July 31, 2013 brought a public announcement that Pluralsight, another online education platform focused on software development training had [acquired TrainSignal for $23.6MM](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/it-educator-trainsignal-acquired-pluralsight-eight-figure-deal). TrainSignal had about 100,000 users and was on pace for $10 million in revenue after earning $7.4 million in 2012.

One year later, I am on track to do it again.

I joined the [Packback](http://www.packbackbooks.com/) team as the Head of Engineering in May of this year. Much like TrainSignal, Packback is responding to a clear message from college students across the country about the painful state of affairs around accessing information printed in textbooks.

With the [support of students and investors](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/etextbook-platform-packback-closes-1m-round-local-angels-and-mark-cuban), Packback is answering this cry for help by offering college students relief in the form of one-day rentals of college textbooks for $3 to $5 in a digital format.

With publisher contracts, rights to 21 textbooks, a small team, and an MVP built on the Magento Community Edition ecommerce platform, Packback launched a pilot of this offering last August.

That pilot was a certified success, and our company has been on a fast track of growth ever since. Our exposure to college students was fueled by a [national appearance on Shark Tank](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2014/03/21/packback-textbook-startup-goes-on-shark-tank/6685545/) (landing a deal with Mark Cuban) along with various national publications [including most recently the Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/08/12/after-shark-tank-packback-seeded-for-pay-per-view-e-textbook-rentals/) which have covered the growth of Packback.

Today, our library boasts more than 2,500 titles available for one-day rental, price comparison for over 300,000 ISBNs, a tool to help students find the highest price when selling physical textbooks at the end of the semester, and a lot fun engineering challenges to help the company scale.

Our team is growing. [I am actively hiring a front-end engineer](http://www.builtinchicago.org/job/front-end-engineer-9) and an open-source developer to join our cause. We are sunsetting the Magento application, building new projects for each business function, and embracing the frameworks, tools and best-practices that help us get the job done well.

Imagine what this story will look like one year from today.
