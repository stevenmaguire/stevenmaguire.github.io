StevenMaguire.com has been a revolving door of content and implementation styles. In [2006](https://web.archive.org/web/*/stevenmaguire.com) it started as static HTML and basic CSS. Next it had a strong run as a WordPress site. Later, homegrown PHP and MySQL replaced WordPress. After discovering Laravel, the site entered the modern age of mature framework support.

Since 2014 itâ€™s back to being static HTML and CSS, with some modern goodies to help keep things manageable.
