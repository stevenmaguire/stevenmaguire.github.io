        <p>Those who can, do. Those who can do more, volunteer.</p>

    <p>I am grateful for the help I received from others through my life. Caring mentors offered me help and guidance at almost every turn. I love to pay it forward. I am proud to volunteer with organizations. I gravitate toward organizations that provide economic education and development to underserved populations.</p>
    <p>I volunteer to give back to my community.</p>
