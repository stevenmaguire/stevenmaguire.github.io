With the excitement of PSR 7 (http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) and the significant architectural improvements made in Laravel 5, it's time to talk about how Middleware will make your development more enjoyable, faster and easier to maintain.

Steven Maguire is back with another talk on the topic of Middleware. Steven will spend some time reviewing and defining Middleware, identify some other technology areas that use a similar pattern, talk about Laravel's implementation of Middleware, all while using an open source website he built to demonstrate key concepts. The demo application will tackle an emerging browser security concern around Content Security Policy enforcement using response headers.
